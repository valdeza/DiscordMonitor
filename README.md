# DiscordMonitor
_It's not stalking if it's a surveillance/intelligence gathering operation._  
Work in progress. Released for the time-being as it supports basic logging functionality (although you have to pipe standard output to a file at the moment).

## Usage
1. Run `gradlew shadowJar` in the project root.
1. Copy _sample.profile.json_ to a new file and adjust it according to your needs (TODO: documentation).
1. Either supply your personalised _.profile.json_ as an argument to the generated .jar file or when the program asks for it.

Classification Reason: 1.4(c)
